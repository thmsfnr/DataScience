## Data Science Project

<em>This project is an analysis of the nuclear phase-out in French electricity production achieved during a course at Polytech Montpellier</em>

*** 

### Description

This project initially aimed to allow us to deepen certain knowledge acquired during our training, to discover others, to identify appropriate methods to meet a given objective, to combine complementary methods, to compare competing methods to meet given objectives, to interpret and possibly compare the results of the methods implemented, as well as to have a critical mindset with regard to the collection of data, the methods implemented and their parameterization.

Concerning the subject, we had the choice between different themes and we chose the one related to the study of open data, more precisely related to the Open Data University project led by the association Latitudes in connection with the national institutional site data gouv. The datasets of this theme are then multiple, knowing that we made the choice to study the one associated with the energy in France 

Regarding the problematic, we have chosen one that differs from the one proposed in the project. Instead of focusing our study on the energy consequences of the war in Ukraine, we are going to determine the consequences of the end of nuclear power in electricity production in France.
